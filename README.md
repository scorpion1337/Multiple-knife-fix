# Multiple-knife-fix
It will remove the multiple knives that may appear to you when you survive many rounds in a row.

# Short presentation.

As you may have noticed when you survive a round in a row, another knife will appear in your inventory and so on. (I think the limete is 3/4 knives). As it was bothering me, I got a resolution for that problem.

# Installation.

To install it just follow these simple steps.

1 - csgo / addons / sourcemod / plugins 
2 - just put it in the "plugins" folder and restart the server.
